Case Study: Wealth Management - Mis-Selling Detection
Business Requirement
A wealth management firm wants to:

Analyze client profiles, transaction records, and product data to detect potential mis-selling.
Integrate and query large datasets (100,000 rows) across CSV, JSON, and Parquet formats.
Perform various aggregations, joins, and filters to create actionable insights for regulatory compliance.

"Datasets used: client_portfolio.csv, transactions.json, product_data (partitioned Parquet)
# Step 2: Extract the ZIP File
zip_file_path = "/home/labuser/Downloads/product_data_partitioned.zip"  # Path to the ZIP file
extracted_dir = "/home/labuser/Downloads/extracted_parquet"  # Directory to extract Parquet files

# Unzip the file
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(extracted_dir)
print(f"Extracted Parquet files to: {extracted_dir}")
