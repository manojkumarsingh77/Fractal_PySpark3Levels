Researchers want to compare the query execution time with and without caching to understand the performance improvement.


3. ðŸ“Œ Business Requirement:
Once analysis is completed, the team needs to free up memory by unpersisting the cached dataset.

The research team wants to store the dataset persistently in both memory and disk to avoid recomputation.


5. ðŸ“Œ Business Requirement:
The IT team wants to verify how data is cached in memory and disk and ensure proper resource utilization.


6. ðŸ“Œ Business Requirement:
The research team performs multiple transformations on the dataset and wants to cache intermediate results for repeated queries.

For low-memory environments, the team decides to store data only in disk and avoid RAM usage.


8. ðŸ“Œ Business Requirement:
A small dataset (hospital details) is frequently joined with clinical trial data.
To optimize performance, the small dataset should be broadcasted instead of shuffled.


9. ðŸ“Œ Business Requirement:
