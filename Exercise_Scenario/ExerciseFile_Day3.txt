Column Operations Scenarios (1-20)
Use DataSet Named: Day3_column_operations_data.csv(It here inside another folder Named Day3Data) - Exercise_Scenario/Day3Data/Day3_column_operations_data.csv


Create Dynamic Risk Flags: Add a column RiskFlag where Low, Medium, and High are determined dynamically based on Assets and RiskFactor thresholds.
Generate a Composite Key: Create a new column ClientKey by concatenating CustomerID and TransactionDate using a separator.
Normalize Revenue: Add a column NormalizedRevenue where each row’s revenue is normalized by the maximum revenue of the dataset.
Calculate Time Difference: Add a column DaysSinceLastTransaction by subtracting LastTransactionDate from CurrentDate.
Rank Customers by Revenue: Add a column CustomerRank ranking customers by Revenue within each Region.
Detect Fraudulent Transactions: Add a column IsFraud where a transaction is flagged if it exceeds 3x the average transaction size.
Create Conditional Discounts: Add a column Discount where values are conditional (e.g., 10% for revenue > $500, 5% for $100-$500, 0% otherwise).
Apply Tax Brackets: Add a column TaxBracket based on Revenue using custom ranges.
Compute ROI: Add a column ROI (Return on Investment) using the formula: (Revenue - Cost) / Cost * 100.
Categorize Customers: Add a column CustomerCategory (e.g., VIP, Regular, Occasional) based on TotalSpending thresholds.
Flag Late Deliveries: Add a column LateDeliveryFlag where delivery times exceeding the expected SLA are marked as True.
Calculate Compound Growth: Add a column CompoundGrowth based on GrowthRate and YearsInvested.
Generate Labels for ML Models: Add a column Label (0/1) for machine learning classification based on whether a transaction is fraud or not.
Segment Age Ranges: Add a column AgeSegment based on the customer’s age range (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-50, etc.).
Calculate Discounted Price: Add a column DiscountedPrice after applying a dynamic discount.
Currency Conversion: Add a column PriceInUSD by converting Price based on the ExchangeRate.
Predictive Scoring: Add a column ChurnScore using a formula based on multiple features like Engagement, TransactionFrequency, and Revenue.
Dynamic Bin Creation: Add a column RevenueBin that dynamically bins Revenue into quartiles.
Categorical Transformation: Convert categorical values in Region into numerical representations.
Derive Weekly Metrics: Add a column WeekNumber derived from TransactionDate for weekly trend analysis.
